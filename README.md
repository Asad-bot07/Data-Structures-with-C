# 📚 Data Structures in C

Welcome to my **Data Structures in C** repository! This project is a collection of fundamental data structure implementations using the C programming language. It is designed to help learners understand core concepts through clear, beginner-friendly code.

> ⚠️ **Work in Progress**  
> I’m adding new code **daily**, so stay tuned for regular updates!
